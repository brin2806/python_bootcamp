#Create a separate function for asking the user for prices.

def prices():
	price_list = []
	user = input("input a price one at a time:")
	price_list.append(user)
	while user != "no":
		return user
		continue
		if user==no:
			break
		
	print (price_list)


#In that function, only ask for one price at a time.
#Use a while loop, to continue to ask for prices until the user enters "no".
#Pass the list to the sum_cart() function.
#Why two for loops. Refactor to one.
